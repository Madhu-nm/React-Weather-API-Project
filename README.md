#🚀 **Weather Forecast App – Powered by React** 🌦️

Excited to share my latest project where I’ve built a dynamic weather forecasting app using React! 🌍 This app provides:

☀️ **Today's Weather** – Get an instant overview of current conditions  
🕒 **Hourly Updates** – Track changes throughout the day with real-time data  
🌬️ **Highlights** – Key metrics such as wind speed, humidity, cloud cover, UV index, sunrise, and sunset times  

💻 This project combines React with live weather data to create an interactive and responsive user experience. Perfect for anyone who loves staying updated with the weather, from daily forecasts to detailed metrics!
